This package enables the ability to load Radiance HDR (RGBE) images
at runtime in Unity. We support RLE and non-RLE encoded images.

## Installing
The easiest way to install is to download and open the
[Installer Package](https://package-installer.glitch.me/v1/installer/OpenUPM/tv.superla.radiancehdr?registry=https%3A%2F%2Fpackage.openupm.com&scope=tv.superla).

It runs a script that installs the package via a
[scoped registry](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-scoped.html).

Afterwards, Radiance HDR for Unity is listed in the*Package Manager*
(under *My Registries*) and can be installed and updated from there.

<details><summary>Alternative: Install via GIT URL</summary>
Add Radiance HDR for Unity via Unity's Package Manager
( Window -> Package Manager ).
Click the âž• on the top left and choose *Add package from GIT URL*.

## Usage
```cs
// Make sure to include the namespace!
using Superla.RadianceHDR;

...
// Load the image however you like in the form of a byte array, be it from
// streaming assets or from the web, etc.
UnityWebRequest www = UnityWebRequest.Get("path/to/image.hdr");
www.downloadHandler = new DownloadHandlerBuffer();
var asyncOp = www.SendWebRequest();
while (!asyncOp.isDone)
{
    await Task.Yield();
}
byte[] imageData = www.downloadHandler.data;

// Pass the byte array to the constructor.
RadianceHDRTexture hdr = new RadianceHDRTexture(imageData);

// Retrieve the generated texture.
Texture2D texture = hdr.texture;
```

## Motivation
During the course of development for other Unity-based projects,
we regularly used HDR images for background
and lighting purposes in our scenes.
Unity handles editor-time import of HDR images without hassle.
While exploring options for user-customisable content,
we were surprised to find the engine did *not* support
runtime loading of HDR images. We decided that needed to be changed!

## Acknowlegements
Radiance HDR for Unity was inspired by the excellent
[three.js](https://threejs.org/) and it's
[RGBELoader](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/dev/examples/jsm/loaders/RGBELoader.js),
which was in turn adapted from Bruce Walter's
[C Loader](http://www.graphics.cornell.edu/~bjw/rgbe.html) for RGBE.
